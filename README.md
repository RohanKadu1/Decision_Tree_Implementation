**Project Report: Decision Tree Implementation for Iris Dataset & Custom OR Logic Dataset**

**Introduction:**
The project report outlines the implementation and analysis of a Decision Tree algorithm for two datasets: the popular Iris dataset and a custom dataset based on OR logic. The goal of this project was to build a Decision Tree from scratch using Python and compare the results with the Decision Tree built using the `scikit-learn` library. The report provides a detailed description of the implementation process, step-by-step explanations of splits, and visualization of the generated decision trees.

**Methodology:**
1. **Dataset Loading & Preprocessing:**
   - The report begins by loading the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - The custom OR logic dataset is created and represented as a DataFrame for easy analysis.

2. **Decision Tree Implementation:**
   - The report introduces the implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm through the `TreeNode` and `DecisionTree` classes.
   - Step-by-step explanations of the various methods used, such as Entropy calculation, Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and splitting, are provided.
   - The process of recursively building the decision tree with the best splits is elaborated upon.

3. **Decision Tree Visualization: Iris Dataset**
   - The report discusses the use of `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` to build and fit a Decision Tree on the Iris dataset.
   - The visualization process is explained, including the generation of DOT format graph description and its conversion to a PNG image using `pydotplus`.
   - The visualization of the Iris dataset Decision Tree is presented and analyzed for insights.

4. **Decision Tree Visualization: Custom OR Logic Dataset**
   - The report outlines the creation of the custom OR logic dataset and the subsequent construction of a Decision Tree on it using `DecisionTreeClassifier`.
   - The visualization of the Decision Tree for the custom dataset is presented, allowing a comparison with the Iris dataset results.

**Results & Analysis:**
- The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Decision Tree built on the Iris dataset and the custom OR logic dataset.
- Step-by-step explanations of the splits help in understanding how the algorithm makes decisions at each node.
- The visualization of the Iris dataset Decision Tree showcases the tree's structure and reveals the feature importance for classification.
- The Decision Tree visualization for the custom OR logic dataset confirms the successful implementation of the algorithm on diverse datasets.

**Conclusion:**
The project report concludes with a summary of the findings, highlighting the successful implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm for both the Iris dataset and the custom OR logic dataset. The step-by-step explanations and decision tree visualizations provide valuable insights into the decision-making process of the algorithm. The report emphasizes the importance of understanding and implementing Decision Trees for various classification tasks and their usefulness in interpreting complex decision boundaries.
